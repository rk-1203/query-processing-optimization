# Query Processing Optimization
The primary goal of this project is to decrease the query processing time by causing changes to the data storage structure on which the query would be executed.We accomplish this goal by taking into some trade-off of expensive query processing procedures in relational databases. Reduce on average, the requirement to join tables in a query by grouping the related RDF Data in a table. Minimise the amount of redundant data processing by reducing extra data storage (e.g., null storage). Include a distributed computing paradigm to balance data processing over several computing nodes to reduce the processing time.
